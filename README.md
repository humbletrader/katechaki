# What is Katechaki?
Katechaki (former reportengine.sourceforge.net) is a lightweight java API for reports. 
The reports can contain paragraphs, tables (with groupings, sorting, and totals/subtotals), pivot tables and other user defined components. 
Katechaki accepts input from memory, files and databases and exports the data in a multitude of formats: HTML, Excel, PDF, PNG, SVG etc. 

# Why Katechaki? 
Well, the former reportengine.sourceforge.net has been revived while I was staying in Athens â€“ Katechaki avenue

# What java version is Katechaki designed for? 
Java 6 or higher

* Katechaki does not have a chart component (but I encourage you to create a report component for charts)
